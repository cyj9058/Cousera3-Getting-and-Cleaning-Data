# The Explanation of project
The goal of the project is that

1. Submit a tidy data set as described below,
2. Submit a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. Submit a CodeBook.md which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work which is performed to clean up the data
4. Submit a README.md which explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.


The data set is about wearable computing data. The data from this course is collected by Galaxy S smartphone. Original data from project is linked as below.

run_analysis.R which is the main code that conducts the following codes
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
